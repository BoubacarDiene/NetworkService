/**
 * \defgroup Core Core service
 *
 * The core service is one of the most important components in this project
 * because it is responsible for loading the network configuration, set the
 * network up accordingly and also apply firewalling rules when relevant.
 *
 * To work properly, the core service relies on low level classes which
 * handle the implementation details (parsing, applying commands, ...).
 *
 * The core service has been designed so that it does not know anything
 * on how the work is really done below. Thus, it only depends on "stable"
 * abstractions called "plugins".
 *
 * @{
 */

/**
 * \defgroup Plugins
 * \ingroup Core
 *
 * Plugins are a set of components that concretize those "stable" abstractions
 * on which depends the core service. They implement the interfaces managed by
 * the core service (Config, Network, Logger, ...).
 *
 * For example, when the core service needs to print some debugging logs, it
 * just performs a function call (always the same) which is handled by the
 * logger plugin. This latter can then "decide" to print the logs to the
 * standard output, a log file, a database, etc. depending on what has been
 * been implemented.
 *
 * This design allows the core service to be extensible without any change in
 * its source code (Open Closed Principle).

     * \brief Create a NetworkService object
     *
     * \param logger An object to use the logger plugin
     * \param config An object to use the config plugin
     * \param network An object to use the network plugin
     * \param ruleFactory An object to use the firewall plugin
     *
     * Note that passed-by-value smart pointers are used here. This choice is
     * well explained below:
     *
     * From
     * https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/c-core-guidelines-passing-smart-pointer
     *
     * - R.32: Take a unique_ptr<widget> parameter to express that a function
     *   assumes ownership of a widget
     * - R.33: Take a unique_ptr<widget>& parameter to express that a function
     *   reseats the widget
     * - R.34: Take a shared_ptr<widget> parameter to express that a function
     *   is part owner
     * - R.35: Take a shared_ptr<widget>& parameter to express that a function
     *   might reseat the shared pointer
     * - R.36: Take a const shared_ptr<widget>& parameter to express that it
     *   might retain a reference count to the object
     *
     * How is that used here?
     *
     * logger:
     * - R.32 would force caller to transfer the ownership of this object to
     *   NetworkService (using std::move) making impossible for the caller to
     *   share it with others.
     *
     * - R.33 is not appropriate because NetworkService does not need to reset
     *   the object.
     *
     * - R.34 is fine because NetworkService also becomes an owner. Thus, even
     *   if others do not use their copy of the object anymore, that would not
     *   impact NetworkService's one. Also, I want NetworkService to be
     *   independent of the lower-level details.
     *
     *   Note: shared_ptr is known to add a little memory overhead due to the
     *   reference counter (see
     *   https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/memory-and-performance-overhead-of-smart-pointer)
     *
     * - R.35, NO for the same reasons as R.33
     *
     * - R.36, better use a simple pointer or a reference to the object as
     *   mentioned in the article
     *
     *   R.34 wins!
     *
     * others:
     * - config, network and ruleFactory are expected to only have one single
     *   user i.e NetworkService so unique_ptr seems appropriate.
     * - NetworkService does not need to reset them so a non-const reference
     *   is not useful hence the choice of R.32 (by copy) which force the
     *   caller to transfer the ownership to NetworkService using std::move.
