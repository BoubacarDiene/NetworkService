 * This class is the high level interface that must be implemented by config
 * plugin. The core service depends on it and not on its implementation(s) to
 * respect the Dependency Inversion Principle. It is possible to retrieve the
 * network configuration in various means that just need to be implemented if
 * required:
 *
 * - From a JSON file (.json)
 * - From a YAML file (.yaml)
 * - From a XML file (.xml)
 * - From a Text file (.txt)
 * - From a database (sqlite, ...)
 * - etc.

 * @note Copy contructor, copy-assignment operator, move constructor and
 *       move-assignment operator are defined to be compliant with the
