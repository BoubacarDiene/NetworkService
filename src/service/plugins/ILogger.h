 *
 * @brief Print logs to help understanding what the service is doing
 *
 * This class is the high level interface that must be implemented by logger
 * plugin. The core service depends on it and not on its implementation(s) to
 * respect the Dependency Inversion Principle. The logger plugin is thus free
 * to output logs wherever it wants:
 *
 * - Standard output
 * - A text file in the filesystem
 * - A remote server listening to a socket
 * - A local database
 * - etc.
 *
 * @note
 * Copy contructor, copy-assignment operator, move constructor and move
 * assignment operator are defined to be compliant with the "Rule of five".
 *
 * @note
 * One purpose in marking its member functions as const is that a const pointer
 * or reference to ILogger can be used to call them.
 * Thus, one can get "const ILogger*" or "const ILogger&" as input if neither a
 * reset of the logger object, nor becoming an owner of it is necessary. Without
 * this const, one would be forced to use "ILogger*" or "ILogger&" in that case
 * thus have possibility to alter the logger object which is not what is
 * expected.
