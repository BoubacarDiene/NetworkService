     * The counterpart is that the logger object must remain valid until
     * this class is no longer used.
     *
     * For example, the following code in "upper layer" where this class
     * is instantiated would make the service crash:
     *
     * // Declare config here
     * {

     * }
     * // Using config here (out of scope) => crash because logger is not
     *    valid anymore.
     *
     * Passing std::shared_ptr by copy would solve that problem but it's
     * fine doing things this way because, by design, the plugins are part
     * of the lower-level details so the "upper layer" which instantiates
     * this class has to know how to properly use it
